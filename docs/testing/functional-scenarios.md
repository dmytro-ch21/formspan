# Functional test scenarios

Recommended end-to-end scenarios for every shipped piece of functionality — one section per feature, written to be translated directly into Playwright tests (`tests/functional/`, the user's own in-progress suite) or the equivalent for mobile. This is a planning/reference document, not test code itself, and doesn't assume or depend on `tests/functional/`'s current shape.

**How to use this doc:** each scenario is a concrete situation + expected outcome, grouped as Happy path / Edge cases & errors / Auth & security. Not every scenario needs its own test — some are natural to combine — but every one listed here should be *covered* by something before a feature is considered done.

**Keeping this current:** this is a living document, same discipline as `docs/decisions/history.md`. Whenever a new module or user-facing feature lands, add its scenarios here as part of finishing that work — see the standing rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Backend health check (`GET /v1/healthz`)

**Happy path**
- Request returns `200` with `{"service": "api", "status": "ok"}`.

**Edge cases & errors**
- API process down / unreachable — dependent clients (web, mobile) show a clear error state, not a silent hang or crash.

---

## Authentication (Clerk + JWKS verification)

**Happy path**
- Signed-out user can complete Clerk sign-in (email or OAuth) and reach an authenticated view.
- A valid session token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `GET /v1/me` returns `200` with the correct `user_id`.
- Signed-in user can sign out via `UserButton` and is returned to a signed-out state.

**Edge cases & errors**
- No `Authorization` header on a protected route → `401 unauthorized`.
- Expired or malformed token → `401 unauthorized`, never a `500` or a raw JWKS/parsing error leaked to the client.
- Token signed by a different Clerk instance/environment (wrong `iss`) → rejected.
- JWKS endpoint temporarily unreachable from the backend → requests fail closed (reject), not open (accept).

**Auth & security**
- Confirm the error body on every rejected-auth case matches the standard `{"error": {"code": "unauthorized", "message": "..."}}` shape — no stack traces or internal error text.

---

## Profile module (`GET/POST/PATCH /v1/profile`)

Domain: one profile per Clerk user — display name, date of birth, sex, and four module toggles (`bjj_enabled`, `strength_enabled`, `nutrition_enabled`, `running_enabled`; BJJ/strength/nutrition default on, running default off).

**Happy path**
- `POST /v1/profile` with a new user's token creates a profile and returns it with default module toggles.
- `GET /v1/profile` returns the authenticated user's own profile.
- `PATCH /v1/profile` with a partial body (e.g. just `display_name`) updates only that field, leaving the rest unchanged.
- Toggling a module off (e.g. `running_enabled: false`) and back on preserves prior data rather than deleting it.

**Edge cases & errors**
- `POST /v1/profile` twice for the same user → second call fails with `409 already_exists`, doesn't silently overwrite.
- `GET`/`PATCH /v1/profile` before ever creating one → `404 not_found`.
- Invalid `date_of_birth` format or invalid `sex` value → `400 invalid_input`, not a raw DB constraint error.
- One user's token can never read or modify another user's profile (no `user_id` param to spoof — enforced entirely via the authenticated token).

---

## Web app shell (`apps/web`)

**Happy path**
- Signed-out visit to `/` shows the "VOLA" landing with a sign-in button (no sidebar).
- After signing in, landing on `/dashboard` shows the sidebar (wordmark, nav, account menu) plus a live healthz check and the authenticated `/me` result.
- Signed-in visit to `/` redirects straight to `/dashboard` (no dead-end landing page for authenticated users).

**Edge cases & errors**
- Signed-out visit directly to `/dashboard` (e.g. a bookmarked/shared link) redirects to Clerk's hosted sign-in, then lands back on `/dashboard` after completing sign-in (`redirect_url` round-trip).
- Backend unreachable while on `/dashboard` → the page shows "Failed to reach API: ..." rather than an unhandled exception or blank screen.
- Sign-out from `/dashboard` returns the user to a fully signed-out state — reloading `/dashboard` afterward redirects to sign-in again, it doesn't serve stale authenticated content from cache.

---

## Mobile auth + offline activity logging (`apps/mobile`)

Domain: Clerk auth (same instance as web/admin) with the session token in the OS keychain, plus offline-first activity logging — local SQLite write, then sync to `POST /v1/activities`.

**Happy path**
- Signed out, the app shows the sign-in screen; the tabs are unreachable.
- Email + password sign-in reaches the tabs. If the account has 2FA, a second-factor step appears with the right prompt for the strategy Clerk offers (TOTP / SMS / **email code** / backup code).
- Session survives an app restart (token cached in `expo-secure-store`, not lost on relaunch).
- Logging an activity while online writes it locally and syncs immediately → shows "synced".
- "Sync now" with nothing pending reports "Nothing to sync."
- Sign out returns to the sign-in screen.

**Offline & sync (verified end-to-end on a real Simulator)**
- With the API unreachable, logging an activity still succeeds locally and shows **pending**, with an explicit error (`Synced 0, 1 still pending — …Could not connect to the server.`) — never a false success.
- The pending row is genuinely in the device's SQLite with `synced = 0` (confirmed by querying the Simulator's `vola.db` directly).
- When the API returns, "Sync now" pushes it → "Synced 1.", the row flips to `synced = 1`, and the same client-generated ID appears in Postgres.
- Because the ID is client-generated and the API's create is idempotent, a retried sync of an already-synced row is a no-op, not a duplicate.
- Not yet covered: no automatic background sync (manual/on-log only), and no conflict resolution — activities are append-only so far.

**Multi-user on one device**
- The local outbox is scoped by `user_id`: signing out and signing in as someone else shows **their** activities, never the previous account's. A shared or handed-over phone is the realistic case here, not a contrived one.
- A row logged offline by user A and still pending when user B signs in must never sync under B's token — idempotency would make that mis-attribution permanent server-side.

**Edge cases & errors**
- Missing `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` → the app throws a named error at startup rather than rendering an app that silently can't authenticate.
- A second factor the app doesn't implement → the error names the strategy Clerk asked for, so the gap is diagnosable rather than a dead end.
- A **local database failure** (failed read, failed insert, bad migration) surfaces as an explicit message — never as "No activities yet.", which would disguise a failure as a legitimate empty state on an app whose whole promise is that the local write survived. This caught a real migration-ordering bug the moment it was added.
- Activity IDs come from a CSPRNG (`expo-crypto` `randomUUID()`), not `Math.random()` — the server treats this ID as an idempotency key, so a guessable one is security-relevant, not just a collision risk.
- A permanent rejection (4xx other than `401`/`408`/`429`) is reported as un-syncable rather than retried forever, so a poison row can't quietly inflate the pending count.
- Verified on the Simulator (loopback); a physical device needs `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` pointed at the dev machine's LAN IP rather than `localhost`.

---

## Exercise library screen (`apps/mobile`, Library tab)

Domain: the mobile-facing view of the global catalog — browse, filter by sport, search by name, with images served from R2 via the API's assembled URLs.

**Happy path**
- The Library tab lists every catalog entry with its thumbnail, movement pattern, load type, and primary muscles.
- Tapping a sport chip filters server-side; "All" clears it.
- Typing in search filters by name, debounced so it doesn't fire per keystroke. Verified live on a Simulator: "press" narrowed to Bench Press and Overhead Press.
- Images come from Cloudflare R2 and are disk-cached by `expo-image`, so a second visit doesn't re-download.

**Edge cases & errors**
- An exercise with no media shows an explicit placeholder, not a broken image or an empty gap.
- `pickImage` falls back (thumbnail → demo → start) rather than showing nothing when the preferred kind is missing — an upscaled thumbnail beats an empty box.
- A failed fetch shows an explicit error; it must never render as an empty catalog, which would read as "no exercises exist".
- A filter matching nothing says "No exercises match this search", distinct from the never-loaded empty state.
- Rapid typing must not show stale results: each request aborts the previous one, so a slow early response can't overwrite a newer one.
- An aborted request is not an error — superseding our own request must not surface a failure message.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- The catalog is fetched, not cached locally, so the Library needs a connection. Given the offline-first design this is a real gap — the catalog is exactly the kind of rarely-changing global content worth persisting on device.
- No exercise detail screen yet: rows are pressable but don't navigate.

---

## Web activities display (`apps/web`)

**Happy path**
- The dashboard lists the signed-in user's synced activities (kind, notes, occurred-at) from `GET /v1/activities` — the receiving end of mobile's sync.
- Timestamps render in explicit UTC (fixed locale/zone), avoiding an SSR-vs-browser hydration mismatch.

**Edge cases & errors**
- No activities → "Nothing yet — log an activity in the mobile app and sync it," not a blank panel.
- API unreachable or non-2xx → an explicit "Failed to load activities: …" message.

---

## Admin app shell (`apps/admin`)

Domain: fully separate from `apps/web`, not athlete-facing. Reuses the same Clerk instance; gated by both middleware (must be signed in) and an `ADMIN_USER_IDS` allowlist check matching the backend's own. **Runs on real backend data** (`/v1/admin/users`, `/v1/admin/users/{userID}/activities`) — no mock data anywhere in this app.

**Happy path**
- Signed in as an allowlisted admin, `/users` (User Lookup) lists every known user — with a profile or with activities: user ID, display name, activity count, last-activity timestamp — all from Postgres.
- Typing in the search field filters rows client-side by user ID or display name substring.
- Clicking a lookup row navigates to `/users/[id]` and renders that user's real activities (kind, occurred-at, notes) with the `request_id`/`trace_id` of the sync request that created each one.

**Edge cases & errors**
- Signed out, visiting `/users` or `/users/[id]` → redirected to Clerk's hosted sign-in, returns to the original URL after completing sign-in.
- Signed in as a **non-allowlisted** user → `/users` renders a plain "Not authorized" message instead of the shell.
- A user with no activities → honest "This user hasn't logged any activities yet" empty state, not a fabricated row.
- Zero users overall → "No users yet — a user appears here once they have a profile."
- Search matching nothing → "No users match this search" (distinct from the zero-users case).

**Auth & security**
- The allowlist check happens server-side (`app/users/layout.tsx`, via `currentUser()`), not hidden client-side UI. More importantly, the **backend independently enforces `RequireAdmin`** on every `/v1/admin/*` route — a non-admin can't reach this data by calling the API directly, so the UI gate is defence in depth rather than the security boundary.
- Admin fetches use `cache: "no-store"` — an admin tool showing a stale render of someone's account would be a correctness bug.

**Log tracing (verified end-to-end)**
- Create a real activity → the admin User Detail row shows its `request_id`; grepping the API's structured log output for that exact ID returns the `POST /v1/activities` line that created it (method, path, status, duration). Confirmed live: `request_id=f7e0fa0c589688d5` appeared in both the admin UI and the backend log.
- There is deliberately **no in-app log viewer** yet — the correlation ID is durably stored so a human can grep the real log stream (local terminal today, Railway's log viewer once deployed).

---

## Structured logging, request IDs, and trace context (`backend/internal/platform/httplog`)

**Happy path**
- Any request to the API gets an `X-Request-ID` response header and a `traceparent` response header (W3C format), and one structured JSON access-log line (`method`, `path`, `status`, `duration_ms`, plus `request_id`/`trace_id`/`span_id`).
- Sending a request with an `X-Request-ID` header already set → the same value is echoed back, not overwritten with a freshly generated one.
- `apps/web`'s dashboard generates one trace ID per page view (`src/lib/trace.ts`) and sends it as `traceparent` on both its `healthz` and `/me` fetches — the backend's access-log lines for both requests share the same `trace_id` with distinct `span_id`s, proving client-side trace correlation actually works.
- `apps/mobile`'s Today screen does the same (`lib/trace.ts`) for its one `healthz` fetch.

**Edge cases & errors**
- Sending a malformed or garbage `traceparent` header → ignored, a fresh trace ID is generated, the request still succeeds (never fails a request over a bad trace header).
- A rejected auth attempt (missing or invalid bearer token on `GET /v1/me`) → a `WARN`-level structured log line (`auth: rejected`, with `reason`) is emitted, correlated (same `request_id`/`trace_id`) with that request's access-log line.
- An unmapped internal error in the profile module → logged server-side via the request-scoped logger (`profile: internal error`), while the client still only sees the generic `{"error":{"code":"internal",...}}` body — the raw error never leaks over the wire.
- The backend's CORS middleware must allow `traceparent` as a request header (`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`) — a real bug caught during verification: without it, the preflight `OPTIONS` succeeds but the actual browser request fails with a CORS error, silently breaking every web-based request the moment a custom header is added.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- `apps/admin` now propagates `traceparent` on its own admin reads too (added when it started calling the backend for real), so all three apps correlate.
- `cmd/migrate` (the one-shot CLI) intentionally keeps its plain `log.Printf` output — request/trace IDs don't apply to it.

---

## Server-controlled feature flags (`GET /v1/flags`)

Domain: operator-controlled, global on/off switches — distinct from the profile module's per-user `bjj_enabled`/`strength_enabled`/etc. toggles. Global booleans only, no percentage rollout or per-user targeting. **Read-only** — there's no write endpoint or admin UI yet; flags are toggled via direct SQL.

**Happy path**
- `GET /v1/flags` with a valid bearer token returns `200` with `{"flags": [...]}`, one entry per row in `feature_flags` (`key`, `enabled`, `description`, `updated_at`), sorted by key.
- The two flags seeded by the migration (`new_recommendation_engine`, `bjj_technique_video_upload`) come back with `enabled: false` by default.

**Edge cases & errors**
- No `Authorization` header → `401 unauthorized`, same as every other non-`healthz` endpoint.
- Zero flags in the table → `{"flags": []}`, never `{"flags": null}`.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- No write endpoint (`PATCH`/`POST`) and no admin-console screen to toggle flags — real backend admin authorization exists now (`RequireAdmin`, see below), so this is no longer blocked on that; just not built yet. Toggling today is direct SQL only.
- No frontend app (web/mobile/admin) fetches or gates on any flag yet — this pass is backend-only, same scoping call as structured logging.
- No per-user/cohort targeting or percentage rollout — add if a real use case shows up.

---

## Theming (`apps/web` light + dark, `apps/mobile` dark-only)

**Web**
- Loads **light** by default on a browser with no stored preference.
- The rail toggle switches to dark and back; the choice survives a reload and applies to every route.
- **No flash of the wrong theme on navigation.** A dark-mode user must never see a white frame — the theme is applied by a blocking inline script before first paint, not after hydration.
- Storage being unavailable (private mode) must not break the toggle; it just stops persisting.
- Solid buttons stay legible in both: lime fill only works against dark, so light uses navy with a lime label.

**Mobile**
- Dark in every case, regardless of the OS appearance setting — the palette exists in one direction only, so following the OS would render a half-styled app on a light phone.
- **No layout container may paint the page background.** Text inside a card sits directly on the card; a nested `View` stamping the page colour over its parent shows as a darker box behind every row, which is what happened before `Themed.View` stopped painting by default.
- The navigator supplies the screen, header and back-chevron colours from the VOLA palette rather than React Navigation's defaults.

---

## Workout authoring on web (`/dashboard/workouts`)

**Happy path**
- Create a workout from the list; it goes straight into the editor, since creating a template is never the goal and filling it is.
- The catalog pane is **always visible** beside the template — adding eight exercises is eight clicks with no modal cycle.
- Targets are edited inline in each row, with the fields decided by the exercise's `load_type`.
- Reorder by dragging, or with the per-row arrow buttons.
- ⌘/Ctrl-S saves; `/` focuses catalog search; Escape closes the create dialog.

**Edge cases & errors**
- Save is disabled unless something actually changed — an always-live Save trains people to ignore it.
- Leaving the page with unsaved edits warns before unload.
- A workout you don't own (shared, or a VOLA template) renders read-only with an explicit banner; the backend remains the boundary.
- The catalog pane scrolls independently, so the template beside it never moves.

**Not yet covered**
- No rename or visibility change after creation. No logging a session against a template.

---

## Workout templates UI (`apps/mobile` Workouts tab, `apps/web` /dashboard/workouts)

Domain: building and browsing workout templates. Mobile is the build surface; web is the read/planning surface, per the mobile-first split in `docs/decisions/system-design.md`.

**Happy path — mobile**
- The Workouts tab lists your templates with discipline, goal, and exercise count; a "Shared" scope shows public ones.
- "New workout" takes a name, a discipline, and — **only for strength** — a goal, since powerlifting/hypertrophy/endurance are things you do with the same barbell squat.
- Opening a workout shows its ordered exercises; "Add exercise" opens a picker.
- Reordering with up/down and removing an item both work; **Save appears only when something actually changed.**
- Verified live on a Simulator: created "Push Day A" (Strength · Hypertrophy), opened it, and the picker listed 498 strength exercises with movement pattern and equipment.

**The picker is filtered to the workout's own discipline**
- A strength workout's picker shows only strength exercises. This isn't cosmetic: workouts are single-discipline and the API rejects a mismatch, so an unfiltered picker would let someone choose an exercise only to be refused on save. Filtering makes the invalid choice **unreachable rather than merely rejected**.

**Target fields are driven by the exercise's `load_type`**
- A barbell squat asks for sets/reps/weight; a plank asks for sets/seconds; a run asks for distance/time. The editor branches on `load_type` alone, so adding an exercise to the catalog never means touching the UI. This is the payoff of carrying `load_type` as data.
- A unilateral exercise says so explicitly — "8 reps here means 8 each side".

**Permissions in the UI**
- A shared workout you don't own, and a VOLA template, both render read-only with an explicit banner rather than edit controls that would fail on save.
- The backend is still the boundary; this only avoids offering an action that would be refused.

**Edge cases & errors**
- **No screen may render an empty state before its first successful load.** The picker, the workouts list, and the library all gate their "nothing here" message on having loaded at least once — otherwise "No matching strength exercises" appears during the first fetch and reads as "this discipline has none". Caught live in the picker during testing.
- A failed load shows the API's own error message where it's actionable (a sport mismatch names the offending exercise), not a bare status code.
- Errors clear on the next *successful* load, not at request start, so a retry doesn't briefly look fine.

**Routing**
- **Pushing a screen over the tabs must not bounce back to the tab root.** The root auth effect redirected any signed-in user off any route outside `(tabs)` — harmless while sign-in was the only such route, and it made the workout detail screen unreachable the moment one existed. Now keyed on the sign-in screen specifically.

**Web**
- `/dashboard/workouts` lists templates in a scannable table; `/dashboard/workouts/[id]` shows every exercise with targets **and coaching notes** — the thing a large screen is genuinely better at and a phone mid-set is worse at.
- The table scrolls inside its own container so the page body never scrolls sideways.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- No drag-to-reorder (up/down only), no rename or visibility change after creation, and no way to log a session *against* a template — which is the point of templates and the natural next increment.

---

## Workout templates (`/v1/workouts`)

Domain: user-owned workout *templates* — an ordered list of exercises with target sets/reps/loads. Distinct from a logged session (`/v1/activities`); keeping them separate is what preserves the planned-vs-actual gap. Shareable via `visibility`, with a nullable owner for VOLA-authored official templates. One discipline per workout.

**Happy path**
- `POST /v1/workouts` with `{id, name, sport, goal?, items[]}` creates it and returns it with items in the order sent.
- `GET /v1/workouts` returns the caller's own plus every public one; `?scope=mine` / `?scope=shared` narrow.
- `PUT /v1/workouts/{id}/items` replaces the whole ordered list — the shape both "add an exercise" and "reorder" take.
- `DELETE /v1/workouts/{id}` removes it; items cascade.
- Retrying `POST` with the same `id` as the same owner returns the original rather than erroring — offline creation must be safe to retry.

**Auth & security — the properties that matter most here**
- **A private workout is indistinguishable from a nonexistent one, on every path.** A stranger calling `GET`, `PUT .../items`, or `DELETE` gets `404 not_found`, never `403`. A 403-vs-404 split would confirm the ID exists, and since IDs are client-generated they're often guessable rather than random — that makes enumeration practical. Regression-tested (`TestPrivateWorkout_IsNotAnExistenceOracle`) because the original implementation had exactly this bug on the write paths while `GET` was correct.
- **A *public* workout returns `403`, not `404`, on write** — the caller can already read it, so there's nothing to hide, and a 404 would disguise a permission problem as a missing row.
- **Visible ≠ writable.** A public workout is readable by anyone, editable only by its owner. Official (null-owner) templates are read-only over the API entirely.
- `POST` with an `id` already owned by someone else → `409 already_exists`, and the response contains none of their data.
- A refused write must also not mutate: the victim's workout is unchanged afterwards.
- `owner_user_id` always comes from the token, never the request body.

**Edge cases & errors**
- **No mixed workouts**: an item whose exercise belongs to a different sport → `400`, and the whole create rolls back rather than leaving a partial row.
- An unknown `exercise_id` → `400 invalid_input`, not a raw foreign-key error.
- An out-of-range target (`target_sets: 0`, an oversized weight) → `400 invalid_input`, **not `500`** — a CHECK violation is bad input, not an internal failure. The message must not carry raw Postgres text, which names constraints and values.
- An unrecognised `?scope=`, `?sport=`, or `?goal=` → `400`, rather than silently returning everything or nothing.
- More than 200 items → `400`; each item is a statement in a batch.
- `visibility` defaults to **private** when omitted — sharing must never be the consequence of a missing field.
- `PUT` with `{"items": []}` clears the list rather than erroring.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- No mobile or web UI consumes this yet.
- No way to rename a workout or change its visibility after creation — "I published this by accident" is currently a dead end.
- `GET /v1/workouts` is unbounded and `scope=shared` grows with the whole user base; needs a limit/cursor before real traffic.
- BJJ workouts only work because two BJJ entries live in the exercise catalog; a real technique library is its own module.

---

## BJJ technique library (`/v1/techniques`)

Domain: the BJJ technique library — 450 entries with position, category, gi/no-gi, and the graph edges (`setup_from`, `common_counters`). Reference content, read-only, seeded from version-controlled JSON generated from the authored spreadsheet.

**Happy path**
- `GET /v1/techniques` returns the library ordered by position, then category, then name.
- `?position=Guard - Bottom`, `?category=Submission`, `?q=armbar` each narrow it; all filter server-side.
- `GET /v1/techniques/{id}` returns one entry with its full edge lists.

**Edge cases & errors**
- **`?gi=Gi Only` must also return techniques marked `Both`** — 304 of 450 are `Both`, so a filter that excluded them would hide most of the library rather than narrow it. Tested explicitly in both directions: `Both` entries appear, `No-Gi Only` ones don't.
- An invalid `?gi=` value → `400`, rather than silently returning nothing.
- LIKE metacharacters are literal: `?q=%` matches nothing.
- `?q=` over 100 characters → `400`.
- `GET /v1/techniques/{unknown}` → `404 not_found`.

**Seeding**
- Idempotent and value-idempotent: a re-seed with unchanged content leaves `updated_at` alone, so delta sync isn't defeated by a deploy.
- Malformed content fails before any write: duplicate ID, missing name/category/position, or an unknown `gi_no_gi` (the one field with a DB CHECK behind it).
- **A test asserts the library still carries graph edges** — if fewer than 90% of entries have `setup_from` or `common_counters`, the library has gone flat and the whole reason for a separate module from `exercises` has evaporated. That's the invariant worth guarding, not the row count.

**Auth & security**
- No `Authorization` header → `401`. Nothing here is user-scoped, so there's no IDOR surface — every authenticated caller gets an identical response.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- Edges are name strings, not resolved references, so nothing validates that a named counter exists.
- `workout_items` can't reference a technique yet, so BJJ workouts remain exercise-only.
- No UI in any client.

---

## Exercise catalog (`/v1/exercises`)

Domain: the global, operator-authored exercise catalog — 524 entries imported from the authored spreadsheet — reference content shared by every user, with no owner. Read-only over HTTP; seeded from version-controlled JSON via `cmd/seed`.

**Happy path**
- `GET /v1/exercises` with a valid token returns the whole catalog, ordered by sport then name.
- `GET /v1/exercises?sport=bjj` returns only BJJ entries; `?q=squat` matches on name.
- `GET /v1/exercises/barbell-back-squat` returns that single entry with its full field set.
- Every entry carries a `load_type` from the fixed set — a client can decide which inputs to render from the catalog alone, with no hardcoded per-exercise knowledge.

**Edge cases & errors**
- Name search is **case-insensitive** (`?q=SQUAT` matches "Barbell Back Squat") — a search that only matched exact case would be useless on a phone keyboard.
- A filter matching nothing returns `{"exercises": []}` with `200`, not `404` — an empty result is a valid answer to a valid question.
- **LIKE metacharacters are literal, not wildcards**: `?q=%` and `?q=_` match nothing rather than the whole table. Binding the parameter prevents SQL injection but not *pattern* injection — different problem, same untrusted input.
- `?q=` longer than 100 characters → `400 invalid_input`; no exercise name comes close, so anything longer is a mistake or an attempt to make the database work for nothing.
- `GET /v1/exercises/{unknown-id}` → `404 not_found`.
- `is_unilateral` is set on per-side exercises (the lunge) — 8 reps per side is not 8 reps, so any volume maths downstream must read it.

**Seeding**
- `cmd/seed` is idempotent: running it twice upserts the same rows, doesn't duplicate them, and preserves `created_at`. It's meant to run on every deploy, so a non-idempotent seed would be a live defect rather than a nuisance.
- Editing the JSON and re-running is how a catalog entry is corrected — there's no write API.
- Malformed seed content fails **before** touching the database: a duplicate slug (which would silently overwrite a different exercise), a missing required field, an unknown `load_type` (which no client could render), or a misspelled `sport`/`movement_pattern` each abort the run with a named error. The typo cases matter because the JSON is the authoring interface — `"strenght"` would otherwise seed a row that no `?sport=strength` filter can ever return, and a bad `movement_pattern` would silently break a future cross-sport rule.
- Seeding is **value-idempotent, not just row-count idempotent**: a re-seed with unchanged content must leave `updated_at` alone. Otherwise it degrades into "time of last deploy" and a client asking "what changed since X" gets the whole catalog back after every deploy — which defeats delta sync on an offline-first app.
- The whole catalog is written in **one transaction**, so a failure partway leaves the previous content intact rather than a half-updated catalog visible to readers.
- **The deployed environment must actually run the seed.** Migration `000004` creates an empty table; without a seed step the API serves `{"exercises": []}` forever, and because that's a valid `200` no healthcheck or error surfaces it. Covered by `railway/api.toml`'s `preDeployCommand`.
- The starter set covers all five `load_type` values, asserted by a test rather than left to drift as content is added.

**Default media**
- An exercise with no photo of its own returns its **sport's placeholder**, flagged `is_default: true` — so the grid never has holes.
- The flag must survive to the client. A placeholder indistinguishable from a real photo makes the coverage gap invisible, and an invisible gap never gets filled — with 463 of 523 exercises lacking their own image, that distinction is most of the catalog.
- An exercise that *does* have its own media never has it replaced.
- A sport with no configured placeholder returns an empty array, not a broken image.
- Placeholders are resolved at read time, not seeded — seeding would be ~1000 rows pointing at six files and would make "which exercises actually have a photo" unanswerable.

**Auth & security**
- No `Authorization` header → `401 unauthorized` on both routes. The catalog isn't secret, but it's app content rather than public marketing, so it sits behind auth like everything else under `/v1`.
- Nothing here is user-scoped, so there's no IDOR surface: every authenticated caller is entitled to the identical response.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- No media (images/video) — planned for object storage with Postgres holding only a key; no bytes exist yet.
- No user-authored custom exercises, no admin write path, and no pagination (12 rows). Filters are applied in SQL rather than in Go, so pagination can be added without rewriting the query.

## Activity module + real backend admin authorization (`/v1/activities`, `/v1/admin/*`)

Domain: the unified "activity envelope" (one table, `kind` + flexible `details` JSONB, not per-sport tables) — Phase 1 of the first end-to-end vertical slice (log on mobile → sync → display on web → find + trace in admin). Also the first real backend-side admin authorization: `RequireAdmin` (Clerk user ID allowlist via `ADMIN_USER_IDS`), closing a gap flagged when the admin console shipped mock-only.

**Happy path**
- `POST /v1/activities` with a valid bearer token and `{id, kind, occurred_at, notes?, details?}` creates the activity, stamped server-side with the caller's `user_id` and the current request's own `request_id`/`trace_id` — `200` with the full row.
- `GET /v1/activities` returns the caller's own activities, newest `occurred_at` first.
- `GET /v1/admin/users` with an `ADMIN_USER_IDS`-listed token returns every user the system knows about — anyone with a profile **or** any activity — as `user_id`, `display_name`, `activity_count`, `last_activity_at`.
- That includes a user with a profile but zero activities, **and** a user with activities but no profile yet (someone who logged before finishing onboarding — exactly the person an admin is most likely searching for). Their `display_name` is null rather than the row being missing. Regression-tested (`TestPostgresRepository_ListUsers_IncludesProfilelessUsers`) because the first implementation started `FROM profiles` and hid them entirely.
- `GET /v1/admin/users/{userID}/activities` with an admin token returns that specific user's activities, each with its `request_id`/`trace_id` — the "trace the request" mechanism: grep the backend's own log output for that ID to see the full request that created it.

**Edge cases & errors**
- **Idempotent create**: `POST`ing the same `id` twice (a real offline-sync retry scenario) returns the *original* row both times — same `request_id`, same `created_at` — never a duplicate, never an error. Verified directly: two live `curl` calls with the same `id` returned byte-identical `request_id`/`created_at`.
- **Idempotency is per-user, not global**: `POST`ing an `id` that already belongs to a **different** user → `409 already_exists`, and the response contains none of that user's data. The caller must never receive someone else's activity, and their own activity must never be silently discarded as a "duplicate". Regression-tested (`TestPostgresRepository_Create_RejectsAnotherUsersID`) — the first implementation looked the conflicting row up by ID alone, which made a guessed or replayed ID an IDOR.
- Missing `id`/`kind`/`occurred_at` → `400 invalid_input`.
- No `Authorization` header on any of these routes → `401 unauthorized`.
- A valid, authenticated token that **isn't** in `ADMIN_USER_IDS` → `403 forbidden` on both admin routes — verified live: a real signed-in token, temporarily excluded from the allowlist, got `403`, then succeeded once restored.

**Auth & security**
- Admin authorization is enforced server-side (`auth.Verifier.RequireAdmin`), not just `apps/admin`'s frontend allowlist gate — a non-admin authenticated user genuinely cannot reach `/v1/admin/*` by calling the backend directly, closing the exact gap `apps/admin`'s own history entry flagged as unresolved.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- `apps/admin` now consumes the admin endpoints for real (Phase 5, done). Still not built: mobile offline logging + sync (Phases 2–3) and web activity display (Phase 4) — so the only way to *create* an activity today is a direct API call.
- `apps/admin` now uses the same `ADMIN_USER_IDS` allowlist as the backend (done in Phase 5) — one admin-identity convention across the stack.

## Session logging (`/v1/sessions`, `apps/mobile` session screen, `apps/web` `/dashboard/sessions`)

Domain: a training session that **actually happened**, and the sets in it — reps, weight, RIR, RPE, and a set *type* (warm-up / working / back-off / drop / AMRAP / to failure). Deliberately distinct from a workout template: keeping the plan and the performance apart is what makes the prescribed-vs-actual gap measurable. Sets are rows, not an aggregate, because "3×5 @ 100" can't say the third set was heavier or the first two were warm-ups.

**Happy path**
- `POST /v1/sessions` with `{id, sport}` starts an empty session; with `sets[]` it starts pre-filled (the template case).
- `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` returns `{session, volume}` — the volume summary is computed server-side so both clients report identical numbers.
- `PUT /v1/sessions/{id}/sets` replaces the whole ordered list — the shape "log another set" and "fix a typo in set 2" both take.
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/finish` stamps `ended_at`; the session then reads as finished.
- `GET /v1/sessions` lists the caller's own, newest first; `?sport=`, `?exercise_id=`, `?limit=` narrow.
- `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}` removes it; sets cascade.
- Retrying `POST` with the same `id` as the same user returns the original — an offline start must be safe to resend.
- **Every measure round-trips**: reps, weight, seconds, distance, RIR *and* RPE on one set, read back unchanged (`TestPostgresRepository_RecordsEveryMeasure`).

**Progressive volume — the property that matters most**
- A session opened from a template shows **zero** working sets, reps and tonnage until sets are ticked off. It must never open at the plan's total (`TestSummarise_CountsOnlyCompletedSets`).
- Each tick moves the numbers by exactly that set's contribution.
- An **uncompleted set contributes no effort** either — it must not set `hardest_rpe` (`TestSummarise_IgnoresEffortOnUncompletedSets`).
- The progression lookup ignores uncompleted sets: a weight planned but not lifted must never become evidence for the next recommendation.
- **Ticking a set starts the rest timer only when "Auto rest timer" is on.** It defaults **off**, so out of the box the Rest button is the only trigger. Un-ticking never starts rest, on or off. Un-ticking is allowed.
- **`completed` must survive the Postgres round trip.** It was written by `insertSets` and never selected back by `attachSets`, so every response reported zero volume and the mobile sync cycle would have written `false` over real flags. Assert it in `TestCreateAndGet_RecordsEveryMeasure` — adding it to that test's *fixtures* without an assertion is what let the bug ship green.
- **Migration check:** existing sets backfill to completed, so historical sessions keep their volume. Only new sets default to not-done.
- **There are five copies of the working-volume rule.** `Summarise` (Go), `localVolume` (mobile session), `workingSets` (mobile Today), the web history list's `working` filter, and the web session header. Changing the rule means changing all five — four of them drifted the first time, and the symptom is two screens reporting different numbers for the same session.
- **Every client that can create a set must be able to mark it completed.** The web logger couldn't, so web-logged sessions reported zero volume and vanished from `LastPerformances` entirely.
- **The client's `localVolume` must match the server's `Summarise` exactly.** It's a deliberate duplicate so the header works offline, and it has already drifted once — the completion rule went into Go only, and a live session showed the plan's full tonnage against unticked sets.

**What the header shows**
- While training: time, sets, reps. **No tonnage, no top RPE.**
- Once finished: tonnage appears. Top RPE never does.
- Both remain in the `Volume` API response — dropping them from the UI must not drop them from the contract, since the trends screen will want them.

**Request cost of logging — worth actually measuring, not just reading**
- One set edit must cost **one** `PUT /v1/sessions/{id}/sets` and nothing else — no `POST /v1/sessions`, no `GET /v1/sessions`. It used to trigger a full `syncSessions` (every dirty session at 2–3 requests each, plus a pull of twenty) *and* re-send the idempotent create every time. Ninety-one requests for fifteen saves.
- The create fires **once per session**, not once per save — the `remote` flag records that the server has it. Deleting the session elsewhere and saving again must recreate it rather than fail forever.
- A push the server *refuses* (404, 409, `invalid_input`) must surface; a push that fails because the network did must not. A failed **local** write must always surface — that one is the save.
- A session whose local blob is unreadable must be skipped by the push, never sent as an empty set list (which would delete the server's copy).
- Reconciliation (`syncSessions`) belongs on screen focus, once — never on the save path.
- A failed push must not raise a banner mid-workout: the local write succeeded and the row stays dirty for the next sync. Only validation errors are worth showing.
- Capture the API's stdout to a file when checking this; `pnpm run dev:api` doesn't persist it anywhere.

**Session duration**
- The header clock runs from `started_at` and keeps time across backgrounding — derived per tick, never accumulated.
- A finished session's duration is fixed and stops ticking; it appears in the mobile recent list and the web history page.

**Rest, per exercise**
- Each exercise header starts its own rest, always available regardless of the auto setting.
- "Auto rest timer" is a **local** preference — the rest timer is mobile-only, so there's no second client to sync with.
- ±15s during a rest **persists to that exercise**, so the correction isn't repeated every set.
- Durations are local to the device by design — the rest timer is mobile-only, so there's no second client to sync with.

**Exercise detail (`apps/mobile` library → exercise)**
- Shows last weight, reps, effort and date, from the same endpoint as the progression suggestion — the two must never disagree.
- An exercise never logged shows an explicit "not logged yet" state, not zeros.
- The catalog entry renders even when the history lookup fails.

**Effort tracking preference (`profiles.track_effort`)**
- Default **on** — the progression rule has no other input, so off-by-default would make the app look broken rather than simple.
- Off hides the RIR and RPE fields entirely, not greyed out.
- Toggling it never alters recorded values; effort already logged stays in the database.
- **It must work with the API unreachable.** The switch reads and writes a local cache and pushes to the profile opportunistically — an earlier version reverted in a `.catch`, so a stopped API was indistinguishable from a broken control.
- Settings and the session screen read the same hook, so the switch and the visibility of the fields can never disagree.

**Volume arithmetic**
- **Warm-ups count toward neither working sets nor tonnage** (`TestSummarise_ExcludesWarmups`). Counting them inflates every number and makes a light day look like a hard one, which would poison anything built on top.
- `hardest_rpe` covers **working sets only** — a hard warm-up single mustn't set the session's headline difficulty. (It originally counted warm-ups, contradicting the schema's own wording; caught in review.)
- `exercise_ids` is the one field that *does* count warm-ups — it answers "what did I train", not "how hard did I train".
- Tonnage is `reps × weight` summed over non-warm-up sets; a set with reps but no weight adds reps and no tonnage.

**Auth & security**
- **A session is never shared, so someone else's is indistinguishable from a nonexistent one** — `GET`, `PUT .../sets`, `POST .../finish` and `DELETE` all return `404 not_found`, never `403` (`TestSession_OtherUsersSession_IsIndistinguishableFromMissing`). IDs are client-generated and therefore guessable; a 403-vs-404 split would confirm one exists. Same property regression-tested on workouts.
- `POST` with an `id` already owned by someone else → `409 already_exists`, carrying none of their data (`TestSession_RejectsAnotherUsersID`).
- `user_id` always comes from the token, never the body.
- `GET /v1/sessions` returns only the caller's rows, whatever the query parameters say (`TestList_IsUserScopedAndFiltered`).
- **A `workout_id` naming someone else's private template is indistinguishable from one naming nothing at all** — both `400`, same message (`TestCreate_PrivateWorkoutIsNotAnExistenceOracle`). Found in review: the field was written straight from the body to the FK, so a visible ID returned `200` and a nonexistent one tripped the foreign key and returned `400` — a working enumeration oracle over private workouts, since their IDs are client-generated and often guessable. Same bug class already fixed on the workout write paths, arriving through a different door.
- A **public** workout (or a VOLA template) *is* usable by anyone — the check gates on visibility, not ownership, or performing a shared workout would break (`TestCreate_AcceptsAPublicWorkoutFromAnotherOwner`).

**Edge cases & errors**
- **No mixed sessions**: a set whose exercise belongs to a different sport → `400`, naming the exercise (`TestSession_RejectsSportMismatch`).
- RPE outside 1–10, or RIR outside 0–20 → `400 invalid_input` naming the offending set index — **not `500`**, and never carrying raw Postgres constraint text (`TestSession_RejectsImpossibleEffortValues`).
- A non-positive rep count, weight, duration or distance → `400` **naming the set**, validated in the handler rather than left to the database's set-less "a value is out of range".
- A session whose `sport` disagrees with its `workout_id`'s sport → `400`; `sessions.sport` is denormalised from the workout and nothing in the schema keeps them honest (`TestCreate_RejectsWorkoutOfAnotherSport`).
- More than 500 sets → `400`; each set is a statement in a batch.
- An unrecognised `?sport=` or a non-positive `?limit=` → `400`, rather than silently returning everything.
- `PUT` with `{"sets": []}` empties the session rather than erroring.
- **Deleting the workout a session followed keeps the session** — `workout_id` goes null (`ON DELETE SET NULL`). History outlives the plan it came from (`TestSession_DeletingWorkout_KeepsSessionHistory`).

**Clients — the behaviours worth testing at the UI level**
- **There is no Save button on either platform.** Every edit writes through, coalesced ~700ms so a three-digit weight is one request rather than three. Killing the app mid-session must not lose the last set typed; navigating away, opening the exercise picker, or finishing the session must each flush a pending edit first.
- A save landing while a field is being typed must not overwrite it — the response updates the volume summary, never the set rows.
- **The previous set's weight and reps carry forward** on "+ Set"; **RIR and RPE deliberately do not**, since the third set at the same weight isn't the same effort as the first.
- Which inputs a set shows is driven by the exercise's `load_type` — a plank asks for seconds, a squat for weight and reps.
- The exercise picker is filtered to the session's own discipline, so a sport mismatch the API would reject is unreachable rather than merely refused.
- Starting from a template pre-fills one row per prescribed set with the prescribed numbers; the session opens ready to confirm, not to retype.
- A finished session is read-only on both clients — no set editing, no "+ Set", no "Add exercise".
- Mobile reloads on screen focus, so a set added in the picker sheet is present on return.
- Web warns before unload while an edit is still pending.

**Regressions worth keeping tests for (all found by using the app, not by review)**
- **`getToken` identity must not change between renders on mobile.** `@clerk/clerk-expo` rebuilds it every render; any screen listing it as a hook dependency then refetches in a loop, overwrites local state mid-edit, and runs unmount cleanups every render. Symptoms to assert against: reordering a workout's exercises must persist on screen, and a set added must stay visible. Use `useAuthToken()` rather than destructuring `getToken`.
- **"+ Set" must insert into its own exercise group**, not at the end of the session — otherwise in a multi-exercise session it forms a second block of the same movement at the bottom while the summary counts it.
- **A decimal weight must be typable** ("72.5" via "72." must survive) — the input holds the raw string, not the parsed number.
- **Saves must be serialised**, and `flush()` must await an in-flight save, or the exercise picker's read-modify-write can silently drop a set.
- **Swapping an exercise keeps the sets already logged**, rewriting them in place. Measures carry over only when the load types match; effort is always cleared.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- **Weights and distances are kilograms and metres everywhere** — there is no unit preference, so a lifter who thinks in pounds can't use the app as-is. Needs a stored preference plus conversion at every display and input site; not built.
- **Sessions are online-only** — unlike `/v1/activities` they don't go through the SQLite outbox, so logging in a basement gym with no signal currently fails. The idempotent client-generated ID is already the right contract for fixing this; the local queue isn't built.
- No rest timer, no supersets (a set belongs to one exercise, and grouping is by adjacency), no per-set notes surfaced in either UI, and no editing of a session's name or notes after it starts.
- No history analytics — nothing yet reads sessions back to show progress over time, which is the point of collecting RIR/RPE at all.
- `GET /v1/sessions` is capped (50 default / 200 max) but has no cursor, so "all of last year" isn't expressible.

---

## Progressive-overload suggestions (`GET /v1/sessions/suggestions`, both clients)

Domain: what to load today for a given exercise, computed from the caller's own history. The first thing in the product that advises rather than records, so it follows the standing rule — deterministic, and it always states its evidence.

**The rule, branch by branch** (all covered by pure-function tests, no database needed)
- 2+ RIR, or RPE ≤ 8 → `increase` by the movement's increment.
- RIR 1, or RPE strictly between 8 and 9.5 → `repeat_consolidate`.
- RIR 0, or RPE ≥ 9.5 → `repeat_hard`.
- No RIR **and** no RPE → `repeat_unknown_effort`. **It must never guess** — the absence of effort data is not evidence that a set was easy.
- Last performed over 28 days ago → `repeat_stale`, **and this outranks effort**: a four-month-old easy set describes someone who has since detrained. Boundary tested at 27 and 29 days.
- Not `weight_reps`, or no weight recorded → `not_applicable`, with no suggested weight.
- Never logged → `no_history`, with no suggested weight.

**Increments scale with the movement**: 5 kg for squat/hinge/olympic, 2.5 kg for push/pull/lunge, 1.25 kg for isolation, core, rotation and anything unmapped.

**Which set the advice comes from**
- The **top working set of the most recent session** containing the exercise — heaviest, then most reps.
- **Warm-ups are excluded**, even when heavier than the working sets. Tested with a deliberately heavier warm-up.
- **Sets with nothing recorded are excluded.** Found against real data: an exercise added to a session and never performed was winning over a real set behind it, erasing genuine history and reporting "not measured in weight".

**Auth & security**
- Scoped to the caller — this reads training history, and `TestLastPerformances_IsUserScoped` is the test that would catch it leaking.
- Missing `exercise_ids` → `400`. More than 100 → `400`.
- The route must not shadow `GET /v1/sessions/{sessionID}`; both are live (verify with two unauthenticated calls, each `401` rather than one `404`).

**Clients**
- Starting a session from a template pre-fills weights: **the plan's prescription wins**, history fills the gaps, reps are never inferred.
- A failed suggestions lookup must not block the session starting — an empty weight is an inconvenience, a blocked workout is a lost one.
- The session screen shows the evidence and the reason verbatim, with a one-tap control to apply the suggested weight to every set of that exercise.
- The apply control is hidden once the sets already carry the suggested weight, and on a finished session.

**Not yet covered / deferred**
- One data point only — no trend, no volume landmarks, no deload logic, and no awareness of a programme's own progression scheme.
- Rep progression isn't suggested, only load. Double progression (add reps to a ceiling, then add weight) is the obvious next rule.

---

## Rest timer (`apps/mobile` only)

Domain: the countdown between sets. **Mobile only, permanently** — an in-progress session is a phone thing, and a rest countdown on a desktop you aren't standing next to is decoration. Do not add scenarios for it under web.

**Happy path**
- The Rest button on an exercise header always starts the countdown. Adding a set never does. Ticking a set does only with "Auto rest timer" on.
- The default comes from the exercise's movement pattern: 180s squat/hinge/olympic, 120s push/pull/lunge, 60s otherwise, and 60s for time/distance work regardless of pattern.
- The bar shows remaining time, the exercise it belongs to, and a progress track that drains.
- ±15s adjusts; tapping the clock pauses and resumes; Skip dismisses.
- At zero it turns green, says "Rest done", and fires a success haptic.

**The property that matters most**
- **The countdown is derived from a stored end timestamp, never from an accumulated tick count.** Background the app for two minutes and the remaining time must be correct on return — a tick-based timer stops when iOS throttles the JS thread, which is exactly what happens when the phone goes in a pocket mid-rest. Test by backgrounding and restoring, not just by watching it run.
- Adjusting while paused must change the frozen remainder, not the (absent) deadline.
- The progress track must never overflow: +15s grows the total as well as the remainder.

**Edge cases**
- Starting a new rest while one is running replaces it and re-arms the completion haptic.
- Leaving the session screen ends the rest — it belongs to the session on screen, not to the app.
- The bar sits outside the scroll view, so scrolling the set list never hides it.

---

## Offline workout execution (`apps/mobile`)

Domain: logging a session with no connectivity. **Test this by actually stopping the API**, not by mocking a failure — both gaps found during development were things a mocked failure would have hidden.

**Happy path, with the API stopped**
- Starting a session (empty or from a cached workout) succeeds and opens immediately.
- The session screen renders: exercise names, the right measures per `load_type`, and a working volume summary — all from local data.
- Editing sets, adding, removing and swapping all persist locally.
- The exercise picker falls back to the cached catalog and filters it by substring.
- The start screen lists **cached workouts**. It must never say "no workouts yet" when the account has some — that's a lie at the worst possible moment.
- Finishing a session works offline.

**On reconnect**
- The session pushes and the dirty flag clears; Today's "N not synced" count goes to zero.
- **`started_at` is the real start time, not the sync time.** Verified: a session created at 22:42:30 with the API down arrived in Postgres with that timestamp.
- A retried push cannot duplicate — the ID is client-generated and create is idempotent.
- Push happens **before** pull, or the server's older copy overwrites unsynced local work.
- A session the device holds dirty is never overwritten by the pull.

**Edge cases**
- A corrupt `sets_json` blob must leave the session openable (empty set list), not throw.
- Local rows are scoped by `user_id` — a shared device must not show or push one account's sessions under another's token.
- Deleting offline removes it locally and best-effort remotely.
- A session started on another device cannot be opened offline; it must say so rather than appear empty.

**Known gaps to write scenarios for once built**
- **Sync is trigger-based** (screen focus, next edit, session start) — there is no connectivity listener, so regaining signal doesn't itself push. A `NetInfo`-driven retry is the next step.
- Suggestions are server-computed and don't appear offline.
- The workout cache covers `scope=mine` only.

---

## Units and settings (`profiles.unit_system`, both clients)

**The property everything else depends on: storage is always kilograms and metres.** Units are display and input only.

- Switching units must **never** change a stored value. Verified by round trip: with Imperial selected, typing `225` into "Weight lb" stores `102.06` kg, which renders back as exactly `225.0` lb.
- Switching to Imperial and back to Metric must leave every logged number identical.
- `PATCH /v1/profile` with `unit_system` outside `metric|imperial` → `400` naming the field.
- **`PATCH` on an account with no profile row** must not dead-end: the clients create the profile and retry, because Settings is reachable without onboarding.
- The preference is per **account**, not per device — set it on the phone, and the web app shows it too.
- Mobile reads it from a local cache first, so a session opens in the right units with no signal.
- The progression suggestion's `reason` must contain **neither "kg" nor "lb"** — the client renders the target in the athlete's own units, and a hardcoded unit would leak metric into a pounds interface. Asserted in `TestSuggest_IncreasesWhenRepsWereLeftInReserve`.
- Distance display switches by magnitude in both systems (m/km, yd/mi) — nobody says "0.02 miles".

**Per-exercise overrides** (`GET`/`PUT /v1/profile/exercise-units`)
- A **missing key means "use the profile default"** — no third state. Clearing an override deletes the row; the client drops the key rather than storing a sentinel.
- Flipping an exercise back to the account default must remove the override, not store a duplicate of the default.
- Overrides are per user: another account's must never appear in yours (`TestExerciseUnits_SetClearAndScope`).
- Setting the same exercise twice upserts rather than erroring.
- An unknown `exerciseID` → `400`, **not `500`** — the foreign-key violation is translated (`TestExerciseUnits_RejectsUnknownExercise`).
- A unit outside `metric|imperial` → `400`.
- **No raw Postgres text may reach the client.** A check violation is mapped by constraint name; the module used to echo `pgErr.Message`, which includes the offending value and the constraint body.

**Unit-aware surfaces:** session logger, workout template editor, workout cards, start chooser. The exercise library shows no weights, so there is nothing to convert there.

**Not yet:** the override applies on the session screen only — the workout editor uses the account default. Distance conversion is implemented but no screen takes a distance input yet, so that path is untested in anger.

## Library filter and search memory (`apps/mobile` Library tab)

- The **sport filter persists** across visits and app launches; it's a standing fact about the athlete.
- The **search box clears** on leaving the tab; it's a question already answered, and finding it still there makes the list look short for no visible reason.
- Both are stored per user — a shared device must not hand one account's filters to the next person.

## Mobile shell (`apps/mobile` tab navigator)

- **No seams.** Header, content and tab bar share one background; there must be no hairline rule or colour step between them, on tab screens *and* pushed stack screens.
- **The tab bar is flat and type-only**: uppercase labels on the app's own ground, a dot above the active tab, one hairline separator. No icons, no pill, no fill. It sits in normal flow, so nothing scrolls underneath it.
- Absolutely-positioned controls (the "New workout" button) sit above the bar, not behind it.
- **The wordmark must not collide with the Dynamic Island** — it sits below it. Check on a device with an island, not just a notch.
- The wordmark's chevron apex must be closed, and must point up.
- Screen names are small, uppercase, top-left; the wordmark is centred and stays centred regardless of the title's width.

## You, profile editing, and Settings (`apps/mobile`)

- **You** shows the display name, enabled sports and current units, and refreshes on focus so a save in Edit is visible on return.
- No profile row yet is an ordinary first-run state, not an error — You shows "Add your name" and Edit starts empty.
- **Edit** saves name, date of birth, sex and sport toggles. It must create the profile first when there isn't one: `PATCH /v1/profile` 404s otherwise, and Settings is reachable without onboarding.
- Tapping the selected sex again clears it — this feeds calorie maths and "unset" has to stay reachable.
- An empty name box saves as null, not an empty string.
- **Settings** is grouped rows with drill-downs, not a flat screen of controls. Units is its own sub-screen.
- **Sign out is in Settings under Account**, confirms first, and appears exactly once in the app.

---

## Modal sheets (`apps/mobile`)

- **Every `Modal` must paint its own background.** A modal renders outside the navigator, so the usual dark ground isn't behind it and `Themed.View` deliberately paints nothing — the sheet falls through to iOS white and near-white text vanishes. Regression-checked on the exercise picker and the new-workout sheet; check any future modal the same way.
- Body text must be legible against the sheet in both the picker and the composer — a screenshot check, since a typecheck can't see it.

---

## Training history (`GET /v1/sessions/history`, `apps/web` `/dashboard/sessions`)

**Happy path**
- A period with training shows five totals, a heatmap cell per trained day, weekly bars and the session list. Every figure comes from the API — none is recomputed in the browser.
- Switching period (4 weeks / 3 months / year) rescopes totals, calendar, chart and list together. No pane keeps stale numbers.
- Clicking a calendar day filters the list to that day and retitles the section; `Clear day` restores the full period.
- Sport chips carry counts from the **unfiltered** breakdown, so each says how much it would find. Selecting one narrows the totals *and* the comparison window — BJJ is measured against BJJ.
- Deltas compare against the immediately preceding window of the same length, not the previous calendar month.

**Edge cases & errors**
- Zero history renders the empty state, not zeroes; filtered-to-empty says so differently from never-trained.
- A sport with no tonnage (BJJ, running) shows `—` for tonnage with no delta caption, and the weekly chart switches to time. It must never draw a flat zero tonnage line and call it training.
- A day with two sessions counts as one active day and two sessions.
- Warm-up sets and sets never marked done contribute to no working-set, rep or tonnage total — the same rule as the session screen. `TestHistoryAgreesWithSummarise` pins the SQL to `Summarise`; it must fail if either moves.
- **Timezone**: a 19:00 session in a UTC-negative zone belongs to that evening's square, not the next day's. Check with `tz=America/New_York` against a session stored at 02:30Z.
- `from` after `to`, a malformed date, an unknown sport, an unknown timezone, or a range over five years each return `400 invalid_input`.
- `to` is inclusive — a session logged this evening appears when `to` is today.
- Distinct exercises and active days are period-wide, so they cannot be reproduced by summing the days.

**Auth / security**
- Unauthenticated → `401`. Another athlete's sessions never appear in any total, day bucket or sport count, whatever `from`/`to`/`sport`/`tz` are set to.

**Visual / accessibility**
- Solid buttons must have legible text in both themes. The `text-*` utility on a `<button>` was silently overridden for the whole app while the button reset sat unlayered — worth an explicit contrast assertion rather than trusting the class name.
- Trained calendar days are focusable and labelled with date, session count and sports; empty days are not focus stops.
- The weekly chart exposes each bar's value as text, so the trend is readable without seeing it.
- Large tonnage renders as `251.1t`, not `251147kg`.

## Training summary on the phone (`apps/mobile` YOU tab)

**Happy path**
- The YOU tab shows Sessions / Days / Time for the span, each with its change against the preceding span of the same length, then a day grid and a bar per week.
- Switching 4 weeks ↔ 12 weeks rescopes tiles, grid and bars together.
- Returning to the tab refetches, so a session logged since is reflected.

**Edge cases & errors**
- A day with training must never render in the rest-day colour. Specifically: a BJJ session with **zero working sets** inside a period that also contains lifting — the intensity measure is chosen per period but read per day.
- A week with sessions but no tonnage is dimmed, not drawn as absent, and the "N weeks in a row" count is taken from sessions rather than from the axis measure.
- No history → an invitation, not zeroes. A failed fetch says so and is distinguishable from "nothing logged".
- The streak counts **weeks**, not days: rest days must not break it. An unbroken run must not appear to reset on Monday morning before that week's first session.
- Large tonnage renders as `251.1t` / `231,196lb`, never `251147kg`.

**Visual / accessibility**
- The three grid colours must stay ≥3:1 against the card and ≥15 ΔE apart under normal vision — re-validate if the ramp or the surface changes, don't eyeball it.
- Trained days carry a date + session-count label; empty days are not accessibility stops.
- Bar heights: a trained week never rounds to invisible, and bars are capped in width so a 4-week span doesn't render as slabs.

## Session list paging, search and filters (`GET /v1/sessions`, `apps/web` History)

**Happy path**
- The list shows one page at a time with "1–20 of 43"; Newer/Older move between pages and disable at each end.
- Every session appears on exactly one page. Ordering is `started_at DESC, id` — without the id tiebreak, two sessions logged in the same second can swap places and one is shown twice while another is never shown.
- Searching by name narrows the list and the count together; clearing it restores them.
- Search and paging compose with the period, sport and picked-day filters, and any change of scope returns to the first page.
- `total` is counted with the same predicate in the same request, so the count can never disagree with the rows.

**Edge cases & errors**
- A search for `%` or `_` matches those characters, not everything — LIKE wildcards are escaped.
- Search is case-insensitive.
- `offset` below zero, `limit` below one, or `q` over 100 characters → `400 invalid_input`.
- A page past the end returns zero rows with the correct total rather than an error.
- A failed list fetch says so and is distinguishable from "no sessions match".

**Client aborts (`apihttp.WriteInternal`)**
- Cancelling an in-flight request must produce **499 and no ERROR log**, not 500. The history page aborts on every filter change, so this is the common path, not an edge case.
- The classification must survive the repository's `fmt.Errorf("%w")` wrapping — assert against a genuinely cancelled query, not a hand-made `context.Canceled`.
- `context.DeadlineExceeded` must still be a 500: that one is ours.
- A real failure must still log and must never leak the cause to the client.

**Wording**
- Cumulative load reads "Volume" everywhere it's visible, on both platforms. The wire field stays `tonnage_kg`.

## Not yet covered (tracked here so it isn't lost, not because it's blocking)

- Mobile has no auth yet (Clerk Expo SDK is a separate future increment) — no sign-in/sign-out scenarios apply to mobile today.
- Web/mobile nav destinations beyond Dashboard/Today (Calendar, Strength, BJJ, Nutrition, Insights, Account / Plan, Log, Progress, Profile) don't exist yet — add their scenarios here when each one is actually built, not preemptively.
- Admin has no real backend data (subscriptions, device/platform tracking, integration sync, support tickets) and no `Jobs & Webhooks`/`Audit Log` screens — none of these are designed yet; add scenarios once each lands for real.
