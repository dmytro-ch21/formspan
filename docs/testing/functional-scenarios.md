# Functional test scenarios

Recommended end-to-end scenarios for every shipped piece of functionality — one section per feature, written to be translated directly into Playwright tests (`tests/functional/`, the user's own in-progress suite) or the equivalent for mobile. This is a planning/reference document, not test code itself, and doesn't assume or depend on `tests/functional/`'s current shape.

**How to use this doc:** each scenario is a concrete situation + expected outcome, grouped as Happy path / Edge cases & errors / Auth & security. Not every scenario needs its own test — some are natural to combine — but every one listed here should be *covered* by something before a feature is considered done.

**Keeping this current:** this is a living document, same discipline as `docs/decisions/history.md`. Whenever a new module or user-facing feature lands, add its scenarios here as part of finishing that work — see the standing rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Backend health check (`GET /v1/healthz`)

**Happy path**
- Request returns `200` with `{"service": "api", "status": "ok"}`.

**Edge cases & errors**
- API process down / unreachable — dependent clients (web, mobile) show a clear error state, not a silent hang or crash.

---

## Authentication (Clerk + JWKS verification)

**Happy path**
- Signed-out user can complete Clerk sign-in (email or OAuth) and reach an authenticated view.
- A valid session token sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `GET /v1/me` returns `200` with the correct `user_id`.
- Signed-in user can sign out via `UserButton` and is returned to a signed-out state.

**Edge cases & errors**
- No `Authorization` header on a protected route → `401 unauthorized`.
- Expired or malformed token → `401 unauthorized`, never a `500` or a raw JWKS/parsing error leaked to the client.
- Token signed by a different Clerk instance/environment (wrong `iss`) → rejected.
- JWKS endpoint temporarily unreachable from the backend → requests fail closed (reject), not open (accept).

**Auth & security**
- Confirm the error body on every rejected-auth case matches the standard `{"error": {"code": "unauthorized", "message": "..."}}` shape — no stack traces or internal error text.

## Profile module (`GET/POST/PATCH /v1/profile`)

Domain: one profile per Clerk user — display name, date of birth, sex, and four module toggles (`bjj_enabled`, `strength_enabled`, `nutrition_enabled`, `running_enabled`; BJJ/strength/nutrition default on, running default off).

**Happy path**
- `POST /v1/profile` with a new user's token creates a profile and returns it with default module toggles.
- `GET /v1/profile` returns the authenticated user's own profile.
- `PATCH /v1/profile` with a partial body (e.g. just `display_name`) updates only that field, leaving the rest unchanged.
- Toggling a module off (e.g. `running_enabled: false`) and back on preserves prior data rather than deleting it.

**Edge cases & errors**
- `POST /v1/profile` twice for the same user → second call fails with `409 already_exists`, doesn't silently overwrite.
- `GET`/`PATCH /v1/profile` before ever creating one → `404 not_found`.
- Invalid `date_of_birth` format or invalid `sex` value → `400 invalid_input`, not a raw DB constraint error.
- One user's token can never read or modify another user's profile (no `user_id` param to spoof — enforced entirely via the authenticated token).

## Web app shell (`apps/web`)

**Happy path**
- Signed-out visit to `/` shows the "Formspan" landing with a sign-in button (no sidebar).
- After signing in, landing on `/dashboard` shows the sidebar (wordmark, nav, account menu) plus a live healthz check and the authenticated `/me` result.
- Signed-in visit to `/` redirects straight to `/dashboard` (no dead-end landing page for authenticated users).

**Edge cases & errors**
- Signed-out visit directly to `/dashboard` (e.g. a bookmarked/shared link) redirects to Clerk's hosted sign-in, then lands back on `/dashboard` after completing sign-in (`redirect_url` round-trip).
- Backend unreachable while on `/dashboard` → the page shows "Failed to reach API: ..." rather than an unhandled exception or blank screen.
- Sign-out from `/dashboard` returns the user to a fully signed-out state — reloading `/dashboard` afterward redirects to sign-in again, it doesn't serve stale authenticated content from cache.

---

## Mobile app shell (`apps/mobile`)

**Happy path**
- App launches in Expo Go to the "Today" tab, showing the "Formspan" heading.
- Today screen fetches `${EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL}/v1/healthz` and renders "API says: api is ok" once it resolves.

**Edge cases & errors**
- Backend unreachable → screen shows "Failed to reach API: ..." instead of hanging on "Loading API status…" forever or crashing.
- Verified on both the Simulator (loopback) and, once relevant, a physical device on the same LAN (`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` pointed at the dev machine's LAN IP rather than `localhost`).

## Not yet covered (tracked here so it isn't lost, not because it's blocking)

- Mobile has no auth yet (Clerk Expo SDK is a separate future increment) — no sign-in/sign-out scenarios apply to mobile today.
- Web/mobile nav destinations beyond Dashboard/Today (Calendar, Strength, BJJ, Nutrition, Insights, Account / Plan, Log, Progress, Profile) don't exist yet — add their scenarios here when each one is actually built, not preemptively.
